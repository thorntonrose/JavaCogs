JavaCogs README

JavaCogs is a small collection of reusable Java classes that I have been
accumulating as I develop applications. For a description of the classes in
JavaCogs, see the javadocs (docs/api/index.html). 

If you don't have a complete distribution of JavaCogs, it can be downloaded
at http://home.mindspring.com/~thornton.rose.

To install JavaCogs, unzip the distribution file (JavaCogs-<version>.zip) to a
directory of your choice, then put javacogs.jar in your CLASSPATH.
